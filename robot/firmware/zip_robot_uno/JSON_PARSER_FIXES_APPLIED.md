# JSON Parser Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Command Retrieval Bug ✅
**Problem**: `reset()` was called immediately after parsing, clearing `lastCommand.valid` before `getCommand()` could retrieve it.

**Solution**: Modified `processByte()` to NOT call `reset()` after parsing. Instead, only reset `state` and `buffer` for the next frame, keeping `lastCommand` valid until `getCommand()` is called.

### 2. Memory Corruption Bug ✅
**Problem**: Arduino `String` class was causing memory fragmentation and buffer corruption, leading to incomplete JSON being parsed (e.g., `["D2"10,"T":0}]` instead of full JSON).

**Solution**: Replaced Arduino `String` with a fixed-size `char` array (`char buffer[257]`) to avoid memory issues. This provides:
- Predictable memory usage
- No fragmentation
- Better performance
- More reliable buffer handling

### 3. Missing Newlines in Responses ✅
**Problem**: JSON responses (`{H_ok}`, `{ok}`, etc.) were sent without newlines, so `ReadlineParser` in test scripts couldn't capture them.

**Solution**: Added `Serial.println()` after all JSON responses to ensure they're properly delimited.

## Code Changes

### `frame_parser.h`
- Changed `String buffer` to `char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE + 1]`
- Added `size_t bufferPos` to track buffer position
- Moved `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` constant before buffer declaration

### `frame_parser.cpp`
- Replaced all `String` operations with `char` array operations
- Added explicit null-termination (`buffer[bufferPos] = '\0'`)
- Improved buffer bounds checking
- Better debug output with buffer length

### `json_protocol.cpp`
- Added `Serial.println()` after all response functions

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed
- Command retrieval mechanism
- Memory corruption issues
- Response formatting

### ⚠️ Remaining Issue
**RAM Usage**: Firmware is using 108.6% of available RAM (2224/2048 bytes). This may cause:
- Firmware crashes
- Unpredictable behavior
- Failure to boot properly

### Next Steps

1. **Reduce RAM Usage**:
   - Review and optimize large buffers
   - Consider reducing `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` if possible
   - Remove unused variables/strings
   - Use `PROGMEM` for constant strings

2. **Verify Firmware is Running**:
   - Check serial monitor for initialization messages
   - Verify robot LEDs/indicators
   - Test with PlatformIO serial monitor: `pio device monitor`

3. **Test JSON Parsing**:
   - Once RAM issue is resolved, test with `test_communication.js`
   - Verify commands are being parsed correctly
   - Check debug output shows proper JSON parsing

## Testing

To test the JSON parser:

```bash
cd robot/tools
node test_communication.js COM5
```

Expected output:
- `[JSON] Parsing buffer: [{"N":0,"H":"hello","D1":0,"D2":0,"T":0}]`
- `[JSON] ✅ Parsed: N=0, H=hello, D1=0, D2=0, T=0`
- `[RX] ✅ JSON command parsed: N=0`
- `{hello_ok}` response

## Debug Output

The firmware now provides detailed debug output:
- `[JSON] Parsing buffer: [...]` - Shows what JSON is being parsed
- `[JSON] ✅ Parsed: N=...` - Confirms successful parsing
- `[RX] ✅ JSON command parsed: N=...` - Confirms command retrieval
- `[RX] Handling motion command N=...` - Shows command routing

## Memory Optimization Needed

Current RAM usage: **2224/2048 bytes (108.6%)**

This exceeds the Arduino UNO's RAM limit and may cause:
- Stack overflow
- Heap corruption
- Firmware crashes
- Unpredictable behavior

**Recommendation**: Reduce RAM usage to < 90% (1843 bytes) for safe operation.
