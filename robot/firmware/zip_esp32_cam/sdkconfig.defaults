# ESP32-S3 WiFi Power Brownout Fix
# Increase Interrupt Watchdog Timer timeout to allow WiFi radio calibration
# WiFi radio requires ~500mA current burst during initialization
# USB power may cause voltage dips that take longer than default IWDT timeout

# Increase Interrupt Watchdog Timer timeout to 3000ms (default is ~300-800ms)
# This allows more time for radio calibration during esp_wifi_init()
CONFIG_ESP_INT_WDT_TIMEOUT_MS=3000

# Increase Task Watchdog Timer timeout to 10s (default is 5s)
CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S=10

# Reduce WiFi power consumption during initialization
# This may help reduce current spike during radio calibration
