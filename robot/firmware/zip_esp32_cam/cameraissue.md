# ESP32S3-Camera-v1.0 Camera Issue - RESOLVED

## Status: RESOLVED

The ESP32-S3 camera firmware has been successfully refactored and is now working with correct GPIO pin mappings. The camera streams video, WiFi AP mode works, and UART bridge to the robot shield is operational.

## Problem Summary (Historical)

The original ESP32 camera firmware crashed during initialization when using PlatformIO with ESP32 framework 2.0.14. The root cause was that the ELEGOO firmware used **ESP32-WROVER** pin definitions (GPIO 34, 35, 36, 39) which **do not exist on ESP32-S3**.

## Hardware Configuration

- **Board**: ESP32S3-Camera-v1.0 (ESP32-S3 chip, revision v0.2)
- **MCU**: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1
- **Camera Module**: OV2640
- **PSRAM**: 8 MB (OPI mode)
- **Flash**: 8 MB (QIO mode)

## Solution Implemented

### Correct ESP32-S3 GPIO Mapping

The firmware was refactored with correct ESP32-S3 GPIO assignments:

**Camera Pins:**
| Signal | GPIO | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| PWDN | -1 | Not connected |
| RESET | -1 | Not connected |
| XCLK | 15 | External clock |
| SIOD | 4 | I2C SDA |
| SIOC | 5 | I2C SCL |
| Y2 | 11 | Data bit 0 |
| Y3 | 9 | Data bit 1 |
| Y4 | 8 | Data bit 2 |
| Y5 | 10 | Data bit 3 |
| Y6 | 12 | Data bit 4 |
| Y7 | 18 | Data bit 5 |
| Y8 | 17 | Data bit 6 |
| Y9 | 16 | Data bit 7 |
| VSYNC | 6 | Vertical sync |
| HREF | 7 | Horizontal reference |
| PCLK | 13 | Pixel clock |

**UART Pins (P8 Header on Robot Shield):**
| Pin | GPIO | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| RX | 0 | Boot strapping pin - protected by boot guard |
| TX | 1 | |

**LED Pin:**
| Pin | GPIO | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Status LED | 14 | Moved from 13 to avoid PCLK conflict |

### Firmware Architecture

The monolithic `main.cpp` was refactored into modular services:

```
src/
├── app/
│   └── app_main.cpp           # Main application
├── drivers/
│   ├── camera/
│   │   └── camera_service.*   # Camera initialization & capture
│   └── uart/
│       └── uart_bridge.*      # UART with boot-safe GPIO0
├── net/
│   └── net_service.*          # WiFi AP management
└── web/
    └── web_server.*           # HTTP handlers & streaming
```

### Key Features

1. **Boot-Safe UART**: GPIO0 is a boot strapping pin. The UART bridge implements a 1000ms boot guard window to prevent external devices from interfering with boot.

2. **Graceful Degradation**: Firmware continues running even if camera fails. WiFi, UART, and web server remain operational.

3. **Health Endpoint**: `/health` returns JSON diagnostics for all subsystems.

4. **Compile-Time Pin Validation**: `static_assert` checks prevent pin conflicts at build time.

## Verification

### Build Output
```
RAM:   [==        ]  15.3% (used 49996 bytes from 327680 bytes)
Flash: [===       ]  25.7% (used 808449 bytes from 3145728 bytes)
========================= [SUCCESS] =========================
```

### Working Features

- WiFi AP: `ELEGOO-XXXX` network
- Camera stream: `http://192.168.4.1:81/stream`
- Single capture: `http://192.168.4.1/capture`
- Health check: `http://192.168.4.1/health`
- TCP robot commands: Port 100
- UART bridge: 115200 baud to Arduino UNO

## Original Problem (For Reference)

### The Error (Before Fix)
```
Guru Meditation Error: Core 1 panic'ed (LoadProhibited). Exception was unhandled.

Backtrace:
  #0  0x4203c203:0x3fcebc70 in ll_cam_set_pin at ll_cam.c:311

  #2  0x42034e92:0x3fcebcf0 in esp_camera_init at esp_camera.c:275
```

### Root Cause
The ELEGOO firmware used M5STACK_WIDE pin definitions for ESP32-WROVER:
- GPIO 34, 35, 36, 39 were used for camera data pins
- These GPIOs **do not exist** on ESP32-S3
- The camera driver's pin validation rejected these invalid GPIOs

### Why ELEGOO's Original Firmware Worked
The ELEGOO binary was compiled for ESP32-WROVER with an older Arduino framework that had lenient pin validation. The binary happened to run on ESP32-S3 hardware, but couldn't be rebuilt with modern toolchains.
